# Abstract

The **ATAS - Academic Text Analysis System**¬†(Brazilian Portuguese SATA - Sistema de An√°lise de Textos Acad√™micos) is an open-source software developed to assist researchers in **textual content analysis**. Inspired by the methodology of **Laurence Bardin [@Bardin:2011]**, ATAS facilitates the **extraction, filtering, and statistical analysis** of academic texts, enabling the identification of semantic and linguistic patterns.

The software is particularly useful for researchers in the **Humanities and Social Sciences**, providing tools for analyzing **keywords, bigrams, lexical categories**, and other quantitative metrics of textual analysis. It integrates natural language processing (NLP) and allows data export to software such as **Gephi** for semantic network analysis.

We emphasize that the tools are in Portuguese, as they were developed by a Brazilian researcher and are being used by the GEPES and GETE research groups.


# Statement of Need

In the Brazilian Humanities and Social Sciences research context, many scholars still rely on manual or semi-manual methods to process and analyze large textual corpora. According to **Metzler et al. [@Metzler:2016]**, barriers such as limited programming skills, lack of access to adequate infrastructure, and scarce training opportunities hinder the adoption of computational approaches in these fields. As a result, essential tasks like identifying thematic patterns, generating bigram networks, classifying authors by gender, and calculating lexical statistics often become labor-intensive and error-prone.

The **ATAS ‚Äì Academic Text Analysis System** addresses these issues by providing an open-source, graphical-interface-based solution that automates these processes without requiring advanced technical expertise. By integrating Natural Language Processing (NLP) capabilities in Brazilian Portuguese, ATAS bridges the gap between sophisticated analytical methods and their practical usability for non-technical researchers. This directly supports more equitable access to computational tools in contexts where language and resource limitations frequently exclude researchers from digital scholarship.

Beyond facilitating traditional content analysis, ATAS expands methodological possibilities for examining the relationship between discourse and spatiality. While **Geographic Information Systems (GIS)** are powerful tools for spatial analysis and thematic cartography, their architecture ‚Äî based on discrete vector and raster data structures ‚Äî tends to produce static ‚Äúsnapshots‚Äù of space. This structural limitation often prevents them from representing the inherently dynamic, processual, and socially constructed nature of geographic phenomena.

As highlighted by **David Harvey [2005; 1980]** and **Milton Santos [1996; 1978]**, geography extends far beyond cartographic representation. Space is not merely a neutral container of events, but a social, political, and economic construct permeated by power relations, symbolic appropriation, and subjective experiences ‚Äî dimensions that resist reduction to numerical variables in a GIS database.

**Gilberto C√¢mara [@Camara:2017a]** critiques this limitation by noting that GIS computational structures often oversimplify spatial dynamics and overlook the dialectics of geographic phenomena. ATAS offers a methodological alternative by enabling the extraction and analysis of ‚Äúdiscursive spatialities‚Äù ‚Äî the ways in which space is constructed, contested, and redefined through language ‚Äî using spatial statistics and semantic networks directly from textual data. In doing so, it complements rather than replaces cartography, offering researchers in the Humanities and Social Sciences a way to capture spatial meaning that is processual, contextual, and deeply embedded in discourse.


# Features and Usage

## 1. Text Filtering (Brazilian Portuguese: Filtragem de Texto)

Extracts **verbs, adjectives, and nouns** from texts, facilitating qualitative analyses.

- **Library used:** `spaCy`
- **How to use:**
  1. Open ATAS and go to the **Filter Text** option.
  2. Select the `.txt` file to be analyzed.
  3. The system processes the text and saves a new filtered file.

## 2. Table Conversion (Brazilian Portuguese: Convers√£o para Tabela)

Generates **bigrams** from the text and exports the data in **CSV** format, useful for analysis in **Gephi**.

- **Library used:** `pandas`
- **How to use:**
  1. Access the **Convert Text to Table** option.
  2. Choose a `.txt` file.
  3. ATAS generates a CSV file containing the bigrams, ready for network analysis.

## 3. Gender Identification (Brazilian Portuguese: Identifica√ß√£o de G√™nero)

Automatically classifies the gender of proper names found in a textual dataset.

- **Library used:** `gender_guesser`
- **How to use:**
  1. Select the **Identify Gender** option.
  2. Upload a CSV file containing a list of names.
  3. ATAS generates a new CSV with the gender classification associated with each name.

## 4. Text Statistics (Brazilian Portuguese: Estat√≠sticas de Texto)

Provides quantitative metrics such as **word frequency, named entities, lexical diversity, and sentiment analysis**.

- **Libraries used:** `TextBlob`, `spaCy`, `pandas`
- **How to use:**
  1. Go to the **Text Statistics** option.
  2. Select a text file.
  3. The system presents a detailed statistical report, including **word clouds and graphs**.

## 5. Graphical Interface

ATAS offers an intuitive visual interface based on `tkinter` and `ttkbootstrap`, allowing users without programming knowledge to easily access its functionalities.

# Implementation

ATAS is developed in **Python 3.8+** and utilizes:

- **`spaCy`** for text processing.
- **`pandas`** for data manipulation.
- **`tkinter`**\*\* and \*\***`ttkbootstrap`** for the graphical interface.
- **`TextBlob`** for sentiment analysis.
- **`gender_guesser`** for gender identification.
